        We are an open-source project developed by students from Rafael Land√≠var
        University, committed to environmental awareness in the digital age.
        <br />
        <br />
        We calculate the ecological footprint of your device using data such as cloud
        storage on Google services and other estimates. Our goal is to encourage
        more sustainable decisions in your digital life. Join us on this journey
        towards a greener and technologically conscious future.

        You should delete irrelevant, duplicate, or expired files, such as
        unnecessary photos, emails, or documents. This action is not limited to
        a single cloud storage service like Google Drive but extends to any
        similar platform you use. Adopting this practice will help you stay
        organized and reduce the energy demand of the servers hosting your data.
        Additionally, consider deleting old or mistakenly created accounts on
        services like Google that you no longer use.
